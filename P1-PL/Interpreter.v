    repeatedly matching against optional states. *)

Theorem equivalence1: forall st c,
(exists i0,
forall i1, i1>=i0 ->
ceval_step st <{ break; c }> i1
=
ceval_step st <{ break; skip }> i1
).
Proof.
  (* TODO *)
Qed.

Theorem inequivalence1: forall st c,
(exists i0,
forall i1, i1>=i0 ->
ceval_step st <{ break; c }> i1
<>
ceval_step st <{ skip }> i1
).
Proof.
