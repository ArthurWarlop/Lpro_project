(** Next, we need to define the behavior of [break].  Informally,
    whenever [break] is executed in a sequence of commands, it stops
    the execution of that sequence and signals that the innermost
    enclosing loop should terminate.  (If there aren't any
    enclosing loops, then the whole program simply terminates.)  The
    final state should be the same as the one in which the [break]
    statement was executed.

    One important point is what to do when there are multiple loops
    enclosing a given [break]. In those cases, [break] should only
    terminate the _innermost_ loop. Thus, after executing the
    following...

       X := 0;
       Y := 1;
       while 0 <> Y do
         while true do
           break
         end;
         X := 1;
         Y := Y - 1
       end

    ... the value of [X] should be [1], and not [0].

    One way of expressing this behavior is to add another parameter to
    the evaluation relation that specifies whether evaluation of a
    command executes a [break] statement: *)

Inductive result : Type :=
  | SContinue
  | SBreak.

Reserved Notation "st '=[' c ']=>' st' '/' s"
     (at level 40, c custom com at level 99, st' constr at next level).

(** Intuitively, [st =[ c ]=> st' / s] means that, if [c] is started in
    state [st], then it terminates in state [st'] and either signals
    that the innermost surrounding loop (or the whole program) should
    exit immediately ([s = SBreak]) or that execution should continue
    normally ([s = SContinue]).

    The definition of the "[st =[ c ]=> st' / s]" relation is very
    similar to the one we gave above for the regular evaluation
    relation ([st =[ c ]=> st']) -- we just need to handle the
    termination signals appropriately:

    - If the command is [skip], then the state doesn't change and
      execution of any enclosing loop can continue normally.

    - If the command is [break], the state stays unchanged but we
      signal a [SBreak].

    - If the command is an assignment, then we update the binding for
      that variable in the state accordingly and signal that execution
      can continue normally.

    - If the command is of the form [if b then c1 else c2 end], then
      the state is updated as in the original semantics of Imp, except
      that we also propagate the signal from the execution of
      whichever branch was taken.

    - If the command is a sequence [c1 ; c2], we first execute
      [c1].  If this yields a [SBreak], we skip the execution of [c2]
      and propagate the [SBreak] signal to the surrounding context;
      the resulting state is the same as the one obtained by
      executing [c1] alone. Otherwise, we execute [c2] on the state
      obtained after executing [c1], and propagate the signal
      generated there.

    - Finally, for a loop of the form [while b do c end], the
      semantics is almost the same as before. The only difference is
      that, when [b] evaluates to true, we execute [c] and check the
      signal that it raises.  If that signal is [SContinue], then the
      execution proceeds as in the original semantics. Otherwise, we
      stop the execution of the loop, and the resulting state is the
      same as the one resulting from the execution of the current
      iteration.  In either case, since [break] only terminates the
      innermost loop, [while] signals [SContinue]. *)

  3.2. TODO: Prove the following six properties of your definition of [ceval].
             Note that your semantics needs to satisfy these properties: if any of 
             these properties becomes unprovable, you should revise your definition of `ceval`. 
             Add a succint comment before each property explaining the property in your own words.
