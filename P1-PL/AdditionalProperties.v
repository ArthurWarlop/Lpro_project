(** * Property of the Step-Indexed Interpreter *)

Theorem ceval_step_more: forall i1 i2 st st' res c,
i1 <= i2 ->
ceval_step st c i1 = Some (st', res) ->
ceval_step st c i2 = Some (st', res).
(* We attempted the proof, but we can't manage to prove the last subgoal. 

 Proof.
  intros i1 i2 st st' res c Hleq Heval.
  induction i2 as [| i2' IH]. 
  - inversion Hleq. rewrite H in Heval. apply Heval.
  - destruct i1 as [| i1'] eqn:Eqi1.

(** * Relational vs. Step-Indexed Evaluation *)

(** As for arithmetic and boolean expressions, we'd hope that
    the two alternative definitions of evaluation would actually
    amount to the same thing in the end.  This section shows that this
    is the case. *)

Theorem ceval_step__ceval: forall c st st' res,
    (exists i, ceval_step st c i = Some (st', res)) ->
    st =[ c ]=> st' / res.
Proof.
Proof.
  intros c st st' res H.
  inversion H as [i E].
  clear H.
  generalize dependent res.
  generalize dependent st'.
  generalize dependent st.
  generalize dependent c.
  induction i.
  - assumption.
  -destruct (ceval_step st c i') as [[st'' res']|] eqn:Heval.
    + apply ceval_step_more. 
 apply IH in E.
      apply E_Seq with (st' := st'') (res' := res').
      * apply Heval.
      * apply E.
    + inversion E.
Qed.

(** 
  TODO: For the following proof, you'll need [ceval_step_more] in a
  few places, as well as some basic facts about [<=] and [plus]. *)

Theorem ceval__ceval_step: forall c st st' res,
    st =[ c ]=> st' / res ->
    exists i, ceval_step st c i = Some (st', res).
Proof.
  (* TODO *)
Qed. 



(* Note that with the above properties, we can say that both semantics are equivalent! *)

Theorem ceval_and_ceval_step_coincide: forall c st st' res,
    st =[ c ]=> st' / res
<-> exists i, ceval_step st c i = Some (st', res).
Proof.
intros c st st'.

(** * Determinism of Evaluation Again *)

(** Using the fact that the relational and step-indexed definition of
  evaluation are the same, we can give a short proof that the
  evaluation _relation_ is deterministic. *)

(* TODO: Write/explain the following proof in natural language, 
         using your own words. *)  

Theorem ceval_deterministic' : forall c st st1 st2 res1 res2,
   st =[ c ]=> st1 / res1 ->
   st =[ c ]=> st2 / res2 ->
   st1 = st2.
Proof.
intros c st st1 st2 res1 res2 He1 He2.
apply ceval__ceval_step in He1.
apply ceval__ceval_step in He2.
inversion He1 as [i1 E1].
inversion He2 as [i2 E2].
apply ceval_step_more with (i2 := i1 + i2) in E1.
 - apply ceval_step_more with (i2 := i1 + i2) in E2.
  -- rewrite E1 in E2. inversion E2. reflexivity.
  -- lia. 
 - lia.
