Inductive aexp : Type :=
  | ANum (n : nat)
  | AId (x : string)              (* <--- NEW *)
  | APlus (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | AMinus (a1 a2 : aexp)

(** Defining a few variable names as notational shorthands will make
    examples easier to read: *)

Definition W : string := "W".
Definition X : string := "X".
Definition Y : string := "Y".
Definition Z : string := "Z".

(** (This convention for naming program variables ([X], [Y],
    [Z]) clashes a bit with our earlier use of uppercase letters for
    types.  Since we're not using polymorphism heavily in the chapters
    developed to Imp, this overloading should not cause confusion.) *)

(** The definition of [bexp]s is unchanged (except that it now refers
    to the new [aexp]s): *)

  | BFalse
  | BEq (a1 a2 : aexp)

(** We can now write [3 + (X * 2)] instead  of [APlus 3 (AMult X 2)],

(** ** Evaluation *)

(** The arith and boolean evaluators must now be extended to
    handle variables in the obvious way, taking a state [st] as an
    extra argument: *)

Fixpoint aeval (st : state) (* <--- NEW *) (a : aexp) : nat :=
  match a with
  | ANum n => n
  | AId x => st x                                (* <--- NEW *)
  | <{a1 + a2}> => (aeval st a1) + (aeval st a2)
  | <{a1 - a2}> => (aeval st a1) - (aeval st a2)
  | <{a1 * a2}> => (aeval st a1) * (aeval st a2)
  end.

Fixpoint beval (st : state) (* <--- NEW *) (b : bexp) : bool :=
  match b with
  | <{true}>      => true
  | <{false}>     => false
  | <{a1 = a2}>   => (aeval st a1) =? (aeval st a2)
  | <{a1 <> a2}>  => negb ((aeval st a1) =? (aeval st a2))
  | <{a1 <= a2}>  => (aeval st a1) <=? (aeval st a2)
  | <{a1 > a2}>   => negb ((aeval st a1) <=? (aeval st a2))
  | <{~ b1}>      => negb (beval st b1)
  | <{b1 && b2}>  => andb (beval st b1) (beval st b2)
  end.

(** We can use our notation for total maps in the specific case of
    states -- i.e., we write the empty state as [(_ !-> 0)]. *)

Definition empty_st := (_ !-> 0).

(** Also, we can add a notation for a "singleton state" with just one
    variable bound to a value. *)
Notation "x '!->' v" := (x !-> v ; empty_st) (at level 100).

Example aexp1 :
    aeval (X !-> 5) <{ 3 + (X * 2) }>
  = 13.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example aexp2 :
    aeval (X !-> 5 ; Y !-> 4) <{ Z + (X * Y) }>
  = 20.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example bexp1 :
    beval (X !-> 5) <{ true && ~(X <= 4) }>
  = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
